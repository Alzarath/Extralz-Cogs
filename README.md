# Extralz-Cogs

## Description
This repository was used to host my miscellaneous cogs for Red V2. It is no
longer maintained. They do not work for V3 and are no longer maintained. The
repository remains for historical purposes.

## Installation
To install these cogs, make sure Red-DiscordBot is up-to-date and add the repository.
